**The API client that lives in your terminal (and your git repo).**

Stop clicking through heavy Electron apps just to send a JSON body. **yapi** is a CLI-first, offline-first, git-friendly API client for HTTP, gRPC, and TCP. It uses simple YAML files to define requests, meaning you can commit them, review them, and run them anywhere.

cd yapi
make install
```

-----

## 🚀 Quick Start

1.  **Create a request file** (e.g., `get-user.yapi.yml`):

    ```yaml
    yapi: v1
    url: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1
    method: GET
    ```

2.  **Run it:**

    ```bash
    yapi run get-user.yapi.yml
    ```

3.  **See the magic:** You get a beautifully highlighted, formatted response.

> **Note:** The `yapi: v1` version tag is required at the top of all config files. This enables future schema evolution while maintaining backwards compatibility.

-----

## 📚 Examples

**yapi** speaks many protocols. Here is how you define them.

### 1\. Request Chaining & Workflows

Chain multiple requests together, passing data between steps. Build authentication flows, integration tests, or multi-step workflows.

```yaml
yapi: v1
chain:
  # Step 1: Login and get token
  - name: login
    url: https://api.example.com/auth/login
    method: POST
    body:
      username: "dev_sheep"
      password: ${PASSWORD}  # from environment
    expect:
      status: 200
      assert:
        - .token != null

  # Step 2: Create a post using the token
  - name: create_post
    url: https://api.example.com/posts
    method: POST
    headers:
      Authorization: Bearer ${login.token}
    body:
      title: "Hello World"
      tags:
        - cli
        - testing
      author:
        id: 123
        active: true
    expect:
      status: 201
      assert:
        - .id != null
        - .title == "Hello World"
```

**Key features:**
- Reference previous step data with `${step_name.field}` syntax
- Access nested JSON properties: `${login.data.token}`
- Assertions use JQ expressions that must evaluate to true
- Chains stop on first failure (fail-fast)

### 2\. Environment Configuration

Manage multiple environments (dev, staging, prod) with a single config file. Create a `yapi.config.yml`:

```yaml
yapi: v1

default_environment: local

environments:
  local:
    url: http://localhost:3000
    vars:
      API_KEY: dev_key_123

  prod:
    url: https://api.example.com
    vars:
      API_KEY: ${PROD_API_KEY}  # from shell env
    env_file: .env.prod         # load vars from file
```

Then reference in your requests:

```yaml
yapi: v1
url: ${url}/api/v1/users
method: GET
headers:
  Authorization: Bearer ${API_KEY}
```

Switch environments: `yapi run my-request.yapi.yml -e prod`

### 3\. Simple HTTP Requests

No more escaping quotes in curl. Just clean YAML.

```yaml
yapi: v1
url: https://api.example.com/posts
method: POST
content_type: application/json

body:
  title: "Hello World"
  tags:
    - cli
    - testing
```

### 4\. Advanced Assertions

Validate complex response structures with JQ-powered assertions.

```yaml
yapi: v1
url: https://api.example.com/users
method: GET
expect:
  status: 200              # or [200, 201] for multiple valid codes
  assert:
    - . | length > 0       # array has items
    - .[0].email != null   # first item has email
    - .[] | .active == true # all items are active
```

### 5\. JQ Filtering (Built-in\!)

Don't grep output. Filter it right in the config.

```yaml
yapi: v1
url: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
method: GET

# Only show me names and emails, sorted by name
jq_filter: "[.[] | {name, email}] | sort_by(.name)"
```

### 6\. gRPC (Reflection Support)

Stop hunting for `.proto` files. If your server supports reflection, **yapi** just works.

```yaml
yapi: v1
url: grpc://localhost:50051
service: helloworld.Greeter
rpc: SayHello

body:
  name: "yapi User"
```

### 7\. GraphQL

First-class support for queries and variables.

```yaml
yapi: v1
url: https://countries.trevorblades.com/graphql

graphql: |
  query getCountry($code: ID!) {
    country(code: $code) {
      name
      capital
    }
  }

variables:
  code: "BR"
```

### 8\. Polling with `wait_for`

Poll an endpoint until conditions are met. Perfect for async jobs, webhooks, and eventual consistency.

**Fixed Period Polling:**

```yaml
yapi: v1
url: ${url}/jobs/${job_id}
method: GET

wait_for:
  until:
    - .status == "completed"
  period: 2s
  timeout: 60s
```

**Exponential Backoff:**

```yaml
yapi: v1
url: ${url}/jobs/${job_id}
method: GET

wait_for:
  until:
    - .status == "completed"
  backoff:
    seed: 1s
    multiplier: 2
  timeout: 60s
```

Backoff waits: 1s -> 2s -> 4s -> 8s... until timeout.

**In Chains - Async Job Workflow:**

```yaml
yapi: v1
chain:
  - name: create_job
    url: ${url}/jobs
    method: POST
    body:
      type: "data_export"
    expect:
      status: 202

  - name: wait_for_job
    url: ${url}/jobs/${create_job.job_id}
    method: GET
    wait_for:
      until:
        - .status == "completed" or .status == "failed"
      period: 2s
      timeout: 300s
    expect:
      assert:
        - .status == "completed"

  - name: download
    url: ${wait_for_job.download_url}
    method: GET
    output_file: ./export.csv
```

-----

## 🎛️ Interactive Mode (TUI)

Don't remember the file name? Just run `yapi` without arguments.

```bash
yapi
```

This launches the **Interactive TUI**. You can fuzzy-search through all your `.yapi.yml` files in the current directory (and subdirectories) and execute them instantly.

### Shell History Integration

For a richer CLI experience, source the yapi shell helper in your `.zshrc`:

```bash
# Add to ~/.zshrc
YAPI_ZSH="/path/to/yapi/bin/yapi.zsh"  # or wherever you installed yapi
[ -f "$YAPI_ZSH" ] && source "$YAPI_ZSH"

# Optional: short alias
alias a="yapi"
```

This enables:
- **TUI commands in shell history**: When you use the interactive TUI to select a file, the equivalent CLI command is added to your shell history. Press `↑` to re-run it instantly.
- **Seamless workflow**: Select interactively once, then repeat with up-arrow forever.

> **Note:** Requires `jq` to be installed.

### 👀 Watch Mode

Tired of `Alt-Tab` -\> `Up Arrow` -\> `Enter`? Use watch mode to re-run the request every time you save the file.

```bash
yapi watch ./my-request.yapi.yml
```

### 🔥 Load Testing

Stress test **entire workflows** with concurrent execution. Not just individual requests - stress test multi-step chains, auth flows, and complex scenarios. Perfect for finding bottlenecks in real-world usage patterns.

```bash
# Stress test an auth flow: login -> create post -> fetch results
yapi stress auth-flow.yapi.yml -n 1000 -p 50

# Run a multi-step workflow for 30 seconds
yapi stress my-workflow.yapi.yml -d 30s -p 10

# Load test against production
yapi stress checkout-flow.yapi.yml -e prod -n 500 -p 25
```

**Options:**
- `-n, --num-requests` - Total number of workflow executions (default: 100)
- `-p, --parallel` - Number of concurrent workflow executions (default: 1)
- `-d, --duration` - Run for a specific duration (e.g., 10s, 1m) - overrides num-requests
- `-e, --env` - Target a specific environment from yapi.config.yml
- `-y, --yes` - Skip confirmation prompt

**Key advantage:** Each parallel execution runs the **entire chain** - login, get token, make authenticated request, etc. This tests your API under realistic load, not just isolated endpoints.

-----

## 🔄 CI/CD Integration (GitHub Actions)

Run your yapi tests automatically in GitHub Actions with service orchestration and health checks built-in.

```yaml
name: Integration Tests
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run Yapi Integration Tests
        uses: jamierpond/yapi/action@0.X.X # specify version, or use @main for latest
        with:
          # Start your service in the background
          start: npm run dev

          # Wait for it to be healthy
          wait-on: http://localhost:3000/health

          # Run your test suite
          command: yapi test ./tests -a
```

**Features:**
- Automatically installs yapi CLI
- Starts background services (web servers, APIs, databases)
- Waits for health checks before running tests
- Fails the workflow if tests fail

**Multiple services example:**
```yaml
- uses: jamierpond/yapi/action@0.X.X # specify version, or use @main for latest
  with:
    start: |
      docker-compose up -d
      pnpm --filter api dev
    wait-on: |
      http://localhost:8080/health
      http://localhost:3000/ready
    command: yapi test ./integration -a
```

See the [action documentation](https://github.com/jamierpond/yapi/tree/main/action) for more options.

-----

## 🚀 Integrated Test Server

Run tests locally with automatic server lifecycle management. Configure in `yapi.config.yml`:

```yaml
yapi: v1

test:
  start: "npm run dev"
  wait_on:
    - "http://localhost:3000/healthz"
  timeout: 60s
  parallel: 8

environments:
  local:
    url: http://localhost:3000
```

Now `yapi test` will automatically:
1. Start your dev server
2. Wait for health checks to pass
3. Run all tests
4. Kill the server when done

**Supported health check protocols:**
- `http://` / `https://` - HTTP health endpoints (expects 2xx)
- `grpc://` / `grpcs://` - gRPC health check protocol
- `tcp://` - TCP connection check (databases, etc.)

**CLI flags:**
```bash
yapi test ./tests                    # Uses config from yapi.config.yml
yapi test ./tests --no-start         # Skip server startup (already running)
yapi test ./tests --start "npm start" --wait-on "http://localhost:4000/health"
yapi test ./tests --verbose          # See server output
```

## 🧠 Editor Integration (LSP)

Unlike other API clients, **yapi** ships with a **full LSP implementation** out of the box. Your editor becomes an intelligent API development environment with real-time validation, autocompletion, and inline execution.

### VS Code & Cursor

Install the official extension from [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yapi.yapi-extension) or [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/yapi/yapi-extension):

**Features:**
- **Run with `Cmd+Enter`** (Mac) or `Ctrl+Enter` (Windows/Linux) - execute requests without leaving your editor
- **Inline results panel** - see responses, headers, and timing right in VS Code
- **Real-time validation** - errors and warnings as you type
- **Intelligent autocompletion** - context-aware suggestions for keys, methods, and variables
- **Hover info** - hover over `${VAR}` to see environment variable status

The extension automatically detects `.yapi.yml` files and activates the language server. No configuration needed.

### Neovim (Native Plugin)

**yapi** was built with Neovim in mind. First-class support via `lua/yapi_nvim`:

```lua
-- lazy.nvim
{
  dir = "~/path/to/yapi/lua/yapi_nvim",
  config = function()
    require("yapi_nvim").setup({
      lsp = true,    -- Enables the yapi Language Server
      pretty = true, -- Uses the TUI renderer in the popup
    })
  end
}
```

Commands:
- `:YapiRun` - Execute the current buffer
- `:YapiWatch` - Open a split with live reload

### Other Editors

The LSP communicates over stdio and works with any editor that supports the Language Server Protocol:

```bash
yapi lsp
```

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Real-time Validation** | Errors and warnings as you type, with precise line/column positions |
| **Intelligent Autocompletion** | Context-aware suggestions for keys, HTTP methods, content types |
| **Hover Info** | Hover over `${VAR}` to see environment variable status |
| **Go to Definition** | Jump to referenced chain steps and variables |

-----

## 🌍 Environment Management

Create a `yapi.config.yml` file in your project root to manage multiple environments:

```yaml
yapi: v1

default_environment: local

environments:
  local:
    url: http://localhost:8080
    vars:
      API_KEY: local_test_key
      DEBUG: "true"

  staging:
    url: https://staging.api.example.com
    vars:
      API_KEY: ${STAGING_KEY}  # From shell environment
      DEBUG: "false"

  prod:
    url: https://api.example.com
    vars:
      API_KEY: ${PROD_KEY}
      DEBUG: "false"
```

Then reference these variables in your request files:

```yaml
yapi: v1
url: ${url}/users
method: GET
headers:
  Authorization: Bearer ${API_KEY}
  X-Debug: ${DEBUG}
```

Switch environments with the `-e` flag:
```bash
yapi run get-users.yapi.yml -e staging
```

**Benefits:**
- Keep all environment configs in one place
- Commit safe defaults, load secrets from shell env
- No request file duplication across environments
- Perfect for CI/CD pipelines with multiple deployment stages
